<!--TODO's  -->

-clean main.js drag: done, dropdown: done
-add alt + left click to get quick info of the node

-Think of adding checkpoint

# v.0.3.0

- Node class
- Board class
  - visualizedPathAlogAnimate
  - drawPathAlgoInstant
- Path Algo
  - Dijkstra
- Maze Algo
- Other

  - [+] Speed: "fast", "medium", "slow" for path algorithms
  - Clear:

- [ ] Board state:

  - idle
  - exploringGraph
  - generatingPath
  - generatingMaze

- [ ] Board status:

  - pure: clean/ has
  - dirty: has something on graph (path drawn / maze drawn)
  - modified: has been modified to new state

- Features:
  - Drag: Done

## NOTE:

- info updation of neighbors is now performed in board in updateNeighborForPathAlgo member function

## TODO:

- mouse event
  [+] mouse drag event:
  [+] nav bar button integration
  [ ] side pannel button integration

- visual:
  [ ] connect block node: making them look one sigle big block
  [ ] start, end and other special Nodes
  . [+] weighted Node
  <!-- [ ] Glich when adding weight to path... it animate slowly due to slow path animation -->

  . [ ] start Node animation
  . [ ] end Node animation: rotating circle

- add animations:

  - Instant animatiton:
    [+] on drag of start and end nodes
    [ ] on toggle of diagonal button
    . [+] working
    . [ ] link it to board state
    [ ] on reset

  - animate:
    [+] when adding block,
    [ ] start, end before starting...
    [ ] During executions of the algos (both type)
    [ ] Special node: when draged to new position they have 50% opacity and update position on drag release
    [ ] animation for path: a continuous flow from start to end
    . [ ] Use 2 rect bar with overflow hidden and one goes out of path block and other animate in... createing a visual of continuous path

- board:
  [ ] Board State: assign different state to each execution phase...

- Future upgrades:
  [ ] Implement Frame Rate
  [ ] Wieghted Node
  . [ ] Customized weight value
  [ ] Checkpoint:
  . [ ] Single Checkpoint
  . [ ] Multi Checkpoint
  . . [ ] <!--? In continuity or Branch out -->
  . . [ ] In order they were added
  . . [ ] By Priority
  . . [ ] Explore: for Dijkstra, BFS
  . . [ ] Connect the drag node to its nearest one
  . . <!--! By order and Priority can be grouped together: the first checkpoint has highest priority and the next one has one lower... as we only drag special nodes and they will remain on the board until deleted -->

  [ ] Diagonals:
  . [+] Diagonal working
  . [ ] Proper diagonal integration
  [ ] Graphical representation
  [ ] Add statistical values against time
  [ ] Key binding:
  . [ ] For navigation
  . [ ] For quick node info
