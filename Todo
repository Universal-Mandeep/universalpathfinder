## TODO:

- mouse event
  [+] mouse drag event
  [+] nav bar button integration

- visual:
  [+] connect block node: making them look one big block
  [+] start, end and other special Nodes
  . [+] weighted Node
  <!-- [+] Glich when adding weight to path... it animate slowly due to slow path animation -->

- add animations:
  - Instant animatiton:
    [+] on drag of start, checkpoint and end nodes
    [+] on toggle of diagonal/checkpoint button
    . [+] working
    . [+] link it to board state
    [+] on reset

  - animate:
    [+] when adding block, weight
    [+] start, end before starting...
    [+] During executions of the algos (both type)
    [+] animation for path: a continuous flow from start to end

- board:
  [+] Board State: assign different state to each execution phase...

- Future upgrades:
  [+] Implement Frame Rate
  [+] Wieghted Node
  . [ !Future ] Customized weight value
  [+] Checkpoint:
  . [+] Single Checkpoint
  . [ !Future ] Multi Checkpoint
  . . [ ] <!--? In continuity or Branch out -->
  . . [ ] In order they were added
  . . [ ] By Priority
  . . [ ] Explore: for Dijkstra, BFS
  . . [ ] Connect the drag node to its nearest one
  . . <!--! By order and Priority can be grouped together: the first checkpoint has highest priority and the next one has one lower... as we only drag special nodes and they will remain on the board until deleted -->

  [+] Diagonals:
  . [+] Diagonal working
  . [+] Proper diagonal integration
  [ !Future ] Add statistical values against time
  [ !Future ] Key binding:
  . [ ] For navigation
  . [ ] For quick node info

<!-- Bugs  -->
  [+] Slow path animation on weighted nodes
  [+] overlaping path animation
